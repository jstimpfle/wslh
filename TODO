====================================

... by adding this syntactic quirk: structural types with "multiplicities" --
i.e.  sets, lists, dicts -- that are direct childs of a struct element are
migrated to the struct's level. For example, let's suppose we have a spec like

    Person: dict for (p d y) (Person p n y)
        pid: value p
        name: value n

and a dataset with the following two persons:

    Person
        value john
            name [John Doe]
            yearofbirth 1970
    
        value jane
            name [Jane Dane]
            yearofbirth 1984

The outermost level is a struct. It contains only the field Person, which is a
dict. We would rather like to write

    Person john
        pid john
        name [John Doe]
    
    Person jane
        pid jane
        name [Jane Dane]

In other words, the idea is to exploit the fact that a struct hast only one
value per field name to eliminiate a level of indentation and eliminate the
pseudo-field "value".
