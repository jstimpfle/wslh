# WSL-H

This is a little language which enables the simultaneous description of an
hierarchical schema and how hierarchies can be queried from, or inserted into,
relational databases.

A python3 implementation of WSL-H is developped as part of the [python-wsl
project](https://github.com/jstimpfle/python-wsl).
