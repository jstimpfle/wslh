# WSL-H

This is a little language which enables the simultaneous description of an
hierarchical schema and how hierarchies can be queried from, or inserted into,
relational databases.

WSL-H is developped for use with
[WSL](http://jstimpfle.de/projects/wsl/main.html) databases but it should be
trivial to use it with almost any relational database.
